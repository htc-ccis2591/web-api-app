# Web API Application

## Assignment Goals:
- Build a JavaScript application object.
- Learn to use an online JSON data web API.
- Use ajax to get JSON data and show an appropriate error messages if the data cannot be obtained.

## Web API
For this assignment, you may use any online web api that you would like. If you need some ideas, a search for "free web json api" on Google yielded a few lists put together by others:
- https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
- https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs
- https://any-api.com/

This is a very open ended project, but I will post a few more specific requirements later. For now, you can get started now by choosing an API and playing around with it.  At a high level, you need to get JSON data from some web API and use that to build a web page in JavaScript, much like what we did for the weather page. 

## Requirements

- A functional web application - No points will be awarded for a non-functional application.
- You must use at least three different web API methods in your application. 
  - For example with the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) 
    - Get Current Weather
    - Get 5-Day Forecast
    - Get 16-Day Forecast
- Use Ajax to update your page with information from the service.  
- Provide an on screen (not an alert) message if the request for data fails.

## Presentation
You must be present in class to present your project, or you may video record your presentation and post it to YouTube sending a link to me through email so that the class can watch your video presentation.  

The presentation should be about 10 minutes long - more than 1 min shorter or longer will result in fewer points.  

The presentation must include:

- A quick overview of the web API chosen.  
- Show the three web API methods you chose to use, pointing out any required input and an overview of the JSON returned.
- A walkthrough of your application object and its properties and methods.
- A walkthrough of your HTML page, showing where the dynamic data is loaded.
- A demo of your working application.
